Instructions for running Project 3: Certified Gas
We recommend running our project in the CLion run tool window. Additionally you may run it on a terminal

1) First choose a song from the data set, the CSV file is included in the repo but it may also be accessed by using the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset

2) Enter the name of your selected song, exactly as it written in the dataset

3) Choose a given attribute to compare your chosen songs with other songs of similar genres in the data set. 
   You can choose your attribute by entering its corresponding number.

4) Choose your algorithm for comparison. We have programmed the sorting of the data set using two algorithms heap sort and quick sort
   Enter H or h for Heap sort and any other value for quick sort.
